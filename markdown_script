## Reading in the data
Data should be in "Comma Seperated Values" (csv.) format to be loaded in and saved in the folder that is consistent with the Working Directory of th R session.


```{r exceptions, echo=FALSE}
exceptions<-read.csv("ISIC_NO_DENTON.csv")
exceptions
```

Load the dplyr package and transform the data into a tbl_df format

```{r exceptions}
library(dplyr)
exceptions<- tbl_df(exceptions)
exceptions
```

Filtering data to contain the sections that we are interested seperatly
```{r exceptions}
Nominal_Q <- filter(exceptions,exceptions$Description=="B nominal")
Nominal_Q$Description <- NULL
```

Convert to time series (not working yet)
```{r exceptions}
library(tibbletime)
Nominal_Q <- as_tbl_time(Nominal_Q, index = Nominal_Q$Time)
```
